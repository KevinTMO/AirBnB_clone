# AIRBNB CLONE
## Introduction
This project was given by Holberton School for us to understand multiple concepts for back-end applications. Concepts that we learned about this project are:

- Json serialization and deserialization
- Args/Kwargs for formatting datetimes
- Class/Instances attributes
- Global scope variables

## Usage of this program:

First, clone this repo in your terminal:

```
git@github.com:KevinTMO/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB_clone/
```
After getting the repo in your terminal, just get inside the repo and execute the console:
```
./console.py
```
This will open our command line interpreter. In here we can use multiple commands like:
- **create** (will create a new instance for the specify class and then print the id)
- **all** (will print all instances of the specify class or all classes)
- **show** (will show all the current instances created for an specify class)
- **update** (will update a class with a new instance)
- **destroy** (will delete an instance)
- **quit** (exit the console)
- **EOF** (It just implement the CTRL-D for exit the console)
- **help** (will show you how to use any other command. Usage: help <command> Ex. help quit)

## Examples of using the console
